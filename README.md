Capacitated Multicommodity Network Design problem: Slope-Scaling Descent solver
===============================================================================


Description
-----------

This program solves CMND problem instances using an SSD heuristic, in order to
showcase the column-generation solver for the capacitated multicommodity
network flow subproblem.

For descriptions of slope-scaling descent, see:
